<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
There are million things that I'm interested in, but let me just list three from the top (Excluding computers and programming)<br>
- Cars<br>
I love driving cars in general.<br>
I love it enough that I made multiple roadtrips between Seattle and New York / Seattle and Los Angeles.<br>
I currently drive Audi A7 55TDI (2016).<br>
It is just fing awesome. No doubt.<br><br>

-  Sports<br>
I like watching European football.<br>
I cheer for Arsenal and Real Madrid.<br>
Sadly..... they both aren't doing great this season..... =(<br><br>

- Traveling<br>
I love traveling.<br>
Whenever I have time, I try to make small/big trips in Korea or overseas.<br>
Aside from the obvious plus' for traveling, it gives me different perspectives and thoughts that weren't exactly in place for me.<br>
Different views and perspectives really endorse me to catch things that I weren't aware of in many ways.
<br><br>
Oh! I shouldn't have to mention that GIRLS are the obvious HIGHEST INTEREST OF ALL TIMES. PEROID. DUH? ;)
