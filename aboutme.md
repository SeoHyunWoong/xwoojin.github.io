<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
There are million things that I'm interested in, but let me just list three from the top (excluding computers and programming)
<p class="about-text">
<strong>Cars</strong><br>
I love driving cars in general.<br>
I love it enough that I made multiple roadtrips between Seattle and New York / Seattle and Los Angeles.<br>
I currently drive Audi A7 55TDI (2016).<br>
It is just f'ing awesome. No doubt.</p>

<p class="about-text">
<strong>Sports</strong><br>
I like watching European football.<br>
I cheer for Arsenal and Real Madrid.<br>
Sadly..... they both aren't doing great this season..... =(<br>
I also love skiing! I like to think that I'm ALMOST A pro skier.. ;)<br>
I skied since I was 4 years old and I absolutely love everything about skiing.<br>
Best mountain that I skied was Whistler (Vancouver, Canada)
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<strong>Traveling</strong><br>
I love traveling.<br>
Whenever I have time, I try to make small/big trips in Korea or overseas.<br>
Aside from the obvious plus' for traveling, it gives me different perspectives and thoughts that weren't exactly in place for me.<br>
Different views and perspectives really endorse me to catch things that I weren't aware of in many ways.
</p>
<p class="about-text">
Oh! I shouldn't have to mention that GIRLS are the obvious HIGHEST INTEREST OF ALL TIMES. PEROID. DUH? ;)
