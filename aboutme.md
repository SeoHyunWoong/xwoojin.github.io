<center>Hello, My name is <strong>WooJin Kim</strong><br>
I am an avid achiever and developer from Seoul, South Korea.</center>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
  Currently an <strong>research engineer</strong> at Wellbia.com. Previously worked as an intern at Samsung Logistics and <strong>web developer</strong> at Washington State University (<a target="_blank" href="http://psychology.wsu.edu/">WSU Psychology</a>)

<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in <strong>Computer Science(CS)</strong> from Washington State University (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsu.edu/">WSU</a>) in Washington State, USA.<br>
Prior to my Bachelor's degree, I've attended Fraser Valley Christian High School and Fleetwood Park Secondary School for my high school diploma in British Columbia, Canada.<br>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I am a programmer, software developer, and a creative thinker. <br>
I like to tackle difficult problems and tasks.<br>
I mean... isn't that why we all signed up for computer science? ^^<br>
I love creating useful and helpful software tools. <br>
Currently, I'm only writing them for my work but I enjoy shortening/automating people's daily task. <br>
I mainly use C/C++/C#/Python but I'm open to any other languages!
